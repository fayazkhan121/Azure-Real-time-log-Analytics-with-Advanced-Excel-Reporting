Organizations using Azure face several key challenges in effectively managing and reporting on the large volumes of log data generated by their Azure resources:

### Accessing and retrieving logs from the Azure portal is a manual and time-consuming process. There is no easy way to programmatically extract log data for analysis.
### The lack of a centralized and automated reporting system makes it difficult to regularly review and share insights from Azure logs with stakeholders. Manual report generation is inefficient.
### Without processing the raw log data, it is hard to gain meaningful insights for monitoring, troubleshooting, and security purposes. The unstructured nature of the logs limits analysis capabilities.
### Visualizing log data in a user-friendly way requires significant effort. Creating graphical summaries and charts from Azure logs is a complex undertaking.
